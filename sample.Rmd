How we obtained the Sample WSS Operators Mexico and what it looks like


```{r SETUP , echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.retina = 2,
                      tidy.opts = list(width.cutoff = 120),  # For code
                      options(width = 120) )  # For output


```

```{r LOADPCK, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
library(forcats)
library(scales)
library(patchwork)
library(countrycode)
library(sf)
library(here) # OKKIO, I am in /DataMEX, because it contains a file `.here`

here::dr_here(show_reason = T)
```






```{r COPYOUTP, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(here)
here::dr_here(show_reason = T)

from_dir <- here("07_output")
to_dir <- here("MexicoWaterSurvey", "output")

files <- list.files(path = from_dir , full.names = TRUE) #,  pattern = ".png$" )
move <- files[sapply(files, file.size) < 100000000] # < 100 MB or Github will get stuck

file.copy( from =  from_dir, to = to_dir , overwrite = T )
# if I had listed with full.names = F
# file.copy( file.path(from_dir, move), to = to_dir  )
```



## STARTING POINT

1. The sample for the survey is mutuated from the sampling design of LAPOP

I looked into the STATA files with the sample of MX - 2016 which surveyd 1,563 IDs located in 260 *clusters* , which covered 110 * municipios* (since samples are proportional to the size of the population, larger municipios have more than one PSU (es Tijuana has 61 & 62))

LAPOP provided a file with geofences that indicate a circle containing each cluster in 2016 (slightly changed in 2018) 

2. In order to match official admin boundaries and shapefile (as in Census 2010), I downloaded from INEGI the ID keys and shapefiles (polygons) for  
+ ENTIDAD (32) 
+ Municipios (2546)
+ Localidades URb( 4525 of 192,217 ) MULTiPOLYGON
+ Localidades Rur (187719 of 192,217) points 
+ AGEB urb- 56195 
 
3. Identification of (expected) clusters for POPA 2018 sample (based on LAPOP) & matching to INEGI keys  admin boundaries (names and shapes)
	--> saved POPA Cluster size by Admin Bound in 
	--> saved SPJOIN RESULTS LAPOP FENCES intersected with Mun (Centroids and fences) 
	 

## The ENTIDADES and MUNICIPIOS INCLUDING LAPOP/POPA clusters (2016 --> closely followed in 2018)

```{r,  echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The ENTIDADES which include LAPOP clusters by # of hh interviewed in 2016", out.width = '100%', results='asis'}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(to_dir,"/01_tmap_PopaSampleE.png"))

#list.files(path = to_dir)
```	
	


```{r,  echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The MUNICIPIOS which include LAPOP clusters by # of hh interviewed in 2016", out.width = '100%', results='asis'}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(to_dir,"/01_tmap_PopaSampleM.png"))

#list.files(path = to_dir)
```
