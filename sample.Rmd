## SOURCES of DATA

1. The sample for the survey is mutuated from the sampling design of LAPOP

I looked into the STATA files with the sample of MX - 2016 which surveyd 1,563 IDs located in 260 **clusters** , which covered 110 **municipios** (since samples are proportional to the size of the population, larger municipios have more than one PSU (es Tijuana has 61 & 62))

LAPOP provided a file with geofences that indicate a circle containing each cluster in 2016 (slightly changed in 2018) 

2. In order to match official admin boundaries and shapefile (as in Census 2010), I downloaded from INEGI the ID keys and shapefiles (polygons) for  
+ Entidad (32) 
+ Municipios (2546)
+ Localidades URb( 4525 of 192,217 ) MULTiPOLYGON
+ Localidades Rur (187719 of 192,217) points 
+ AGEB urb- 56195 
 
3. Identification of (expected) clusters for POPA 2018 sample (based on LAPOP) & matching to INEGI keys admin boundaries (names and shapes)
	--> saved POPA Cluster size by Admin Bound in 
	--> saved SPJOIN RESULTS LAPOP FENCES intersected with Mun (Centroids and fences) 
	 

## The ENTIDADES and MUNICIPIOS INCLUDING LAPOP/POPA clusters (2016 --> closely followed in 2018)

## A LOOK AT THE WATER & SANITATION SERVICE PROVIDERS - SPECIFICALLY IN THE SURVEY AREA

The service providers *"prestadores de los servicios de agua y saneamiento"* in Mexico are extremely heterogeneous in nature and conditions. 

The classification that we use is mostly derived from the Nota Tecnica prepared by some colleagues of the IADB, WSA division [See @riquelme_organismos_2018, pp. 1-3].
