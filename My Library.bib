	abstract = {This systematic review of urban planning studies in developing countries found that top-down efforts are ineffective for connecting populations to centralised water, sanitation or electricity services. Bottom up, participatory approaches are effective for local sanitation solutions, but not for water supply or connectivity to other services.
Services provided by public or private agencies through centralised planning and implementation (top-down) appeared effective in individual studies for connecting populations to water, sanitation and electricity. However, where studies were sufficiently similar to justify pooling findings in a statistical meta-analysis, this conclusion was not confirmed. Qualitative synthesis of contextual factors suggest a need for the customisation of solutions to meet local needs, and better delivery of services by alternative/non-government service providers.
Participatory (bottom-up) approaches adopted by NGOs and CBOs suit the construction and maintenance of toilets, which can be standalone, and statistical meta-analysis confirms their effectiveness for individual but not community toilets. Although studies of bottom-up approaches to improving water access appeared positive more often than studies of top down approaches, this difference was not statistically significant in a meta-analysis. Moreover, bottom-up approaches suffer from problems of scaling-up. Replication of successful models may not always be possible, since the same conditions may not be present in different locations.
Neighbourhoods without security of tenure are rarely served well top-down. Bottom-up approaches are also limited in this context, and also in Africa where efforts may be hampered by particularly modest levels of economic development. Public-private partnerships show promise for top-down approaches to improving water supply. Bottom-up, NGO led initiatives for improving water supply need the cooperation and support of the public sector.},

 the complexity faced by the water sector as a whole (from
 irrigation to flood protection, to water conservation and
 hydropower), there is great demand for future exploring the
 potential of RBF and tackling the questions still unanswered
 about many of its operational dimensions. This document
 takes a closer look at some of the practical aspects of
 implementing various RBF water schemes. Chapter 2 provides
 an analytical framework to explore if and when RBF can be a
 viable option, shedding light on some key factors and
 preconditions that are necessary for RBF to work--with the
 understanding that it can be used either as an alternative
 or a complement to a more traditional input-based funding
 scheme. Chapter 3 then revisits the concepts discussed in
 the analytical framework through the analysis of various
 case studies of RBF approaches in different water-related
 areas. Some of the case studies are based on actual projects
 already implemented or ongoing, while others are an
 illustrative elaboration, given the lack of practical cases
 to use as sources. Chapter 4 presents some conclusions and
 lessons learned. The key challenges that are likely to be
 encountered in designing an RBF scheme deal with: the
 clarity and level of certainty of the relationships from
 input to output to outcomes (causal links); the ease and
 availability of measurable indicators; and, consequently,
 the optimal determination of the necessary incentive(s) to
 align the goals of the principal with the agents'
 deliverables. Appendix A presents a glossary of RBF concepts
 and acronyms. Appendix B presents specific results and
 indicators which may be relevant for different sectors.},

	abstract = {In Brazilian urban favelas, the development of informal connections is common,
relatively easy to obtain, and allow citizens to acquire electricity eluding or reducing
the regular charging of consumption. Genuine affordability problems and limited
means of subsistence are the most important but not exhaustive explanation of theft
and nonpayment problems afflicting energy distribution companies. With a preliminary
evaluation of the project “Conviver: energia para viver melhor”, implemented in Belo
Horizonte, this thesis studies the determinants of illegal connections and energy fraud
in the context of low-income urban favelas. Using the tecnique of logistic regression,
the study illustrates how the probability of engaging in illegal behavior is explained by
the following concurring factors: inadequate energy provision and lacking equipment;
income and affordability; inefficient and incorrect use of domestic electric appliances.
Additionally, based on the Conviver sample of 15,279 households, the thesis provides
an evaluation of the effectiveness of different pro-poor schemes (government poverty
subsidies and electricity block tariffs) at subsidizing energy costs for poor customers.
The analysis proves that social tariffs, even though not exclusively responsible, can be
considered as factors that mitigate the occurrence of illegality. The type of social tariffs
that work better are the ones that are more strictly connected to consumption, as
opposed to those linked to poverty subsidies. This make a strong case for a “tariff
engineering” that takes into serious account the electricity needs in term of
consumption, and try to segment the customers to realistically match the actual needs
(minimum; low-medium; houses with micro-businesses in the dwelling). As the
preliminary outcomes of the Conviver program document, the positive effect of propoor
tariff schemes will be even multiplied if combined with effort for the orientation
of low-income customers to energy-saving behaviors.},

	abstract = {Indian cities have large populations of urban slum dwellers who lack access to basic services from utility providers. Many households obtain access to electricity through illegal connections, which can be unsafe and contribute to commercial distribution losses at utilities. To address this challenge, the Indian electricity act of 2003 introduced a provision to increase formal access by requiring electric utilities to connect and supply any customer who can provide proof of residency. In 2009, the global partnership on output-based aid (GPOBA) approved a pilot project for 1.652 million dollars with the objective of increasing access to safe electricity supply in Indian slums through targeted output-based subsides. The pilot focused on selected urban slum areas of Mumbai, but had potential for scale-up in other communities in Mumbai and across India if successfully implemented. The slum rehabilitation society reported that many households expressed willingness to connect under the project, but were unwilling to pay the required end-user contribution. During the life of the project, Reliance (RIL) made about 7,000 new connections in Shivaji Nagar (outside of the OBA subsidy scheme); households used local electricians to install wiring that did not necessarily conform with the technical standards required by the project but cost significantly less},

	abstract = {The Government of Bangladesh, with help from the
World Bank and other donors, has provided aid to
a local agency called Infrastructure Development
Company Limited and its partner organizations to
devise a credit scheme for marketing solar home system
units and making these an affordable alternative to grid
electricity for poor people in remote areas. This paper
uses household survey data to examine the financing
scheme behind the dissemination of these solar home
systems, in particular the role of the subsidy; the
factors that determine the adoption of the systems
in rural Bangladesh; and the welfare impacts of such
adoption. The paper finds that while the subsidy has
been declining over time, the demand for solar home
systems has seen phenomenal growth, mostly because of technological developments that have made the systems
increasingly more affordable. Households with better
physical and educational endowments are more likely
to adopt solar home systems than poor households.
The price of the system matters in household decision
making—a 10 percent decline in the price of the system
increases the overall demand for a solar panel by 2
percent. As for the benefits, adoption of a solar home
system improves children’s evening study time, lowers
kerosene consumption, and provides health benefits for
household members, in particular for women. It is also
found to increase women’s decision-making ability in
certain household affairs. Finally, it is found to increase
household consumption expenditure, although at a small
scale.},

This paper reports mid-term results of a World Bank Global Program for Output Based Aid (GPOBA) subsidized expansion of public piped water points into slum and peri-urban areas of Kampala, Uganda. The project funded public and private yard taps, as well as two types of public water points (PWPs) that each serve up to 30 households. We provide preliminary evidence on two related objectives. We estimate the impact of an increase in the supply of cleaner piped water on the health and well-being of beneficiaries using the staggered nature of infrastructure roll-out. Despite the very slow implementation of the project, we find that the program had a substantive impact on households’ access to water: both distance to water source and price of a standard container fall. These improvements in access do not translate into increases in reported volumes of water consumed. However, we document large time savings associated with the project, particularly for adults. The mid-line results on illness are surprising, albeit too preliminary to be conclusive: the likelihood of self-reported illness in the past two weeks is higher in program areas. Furthermore, the increase in illness incidence is not driven by diarrheal diseases. Finally, we document an increase in the rental value of household units, that potentially reflects the capitalized value of the gains due to the program.},

	abstract = {This report originated as a contribution to the “Program of Integrated Public Policies for the Youth,” through which the IDB is supporting the Brazilian Municipality of Fortaleza in fostering socio-economic inclusion for young people in disadvantaged contexts. 
The first contribution of the study is to offer a synthetic outline of the issues and challenges relative to social and productive exclusion of young people, distinguishing between developed and developing regions, with special attention to Brazil. The report identifies and outlines, with empirical evidence, the following five macro-challenges that youth employment currently poses to countries like Brazil. Namely: (a) insufficient educational attainment and quality; (b) poverty, vulnerability, and youth at risk; (c) mismatch in labor supply and demand; (d) lack of opportunities and high incidence of informality; and (e) expected labor market effects of the ongoing crisis.
Against such a framework, the study identifies and describes eight worldwide best practices in the field of youth employment policies. The choice of the case studies maintains an explicit focus on programs with an emphasis on the promotion of self-employment and entrepreneurship as alternative tools to tap an existing under-exploited young entrepreneurial potential, in a context of shrinking labor demand from the public and formal sector. 
The identified most successful and sustainable programs (retrieved in a variety of different contexts) consistently show some common key success factors. In particular, they exhibit an emphasis on selection and targeting (according to age, education level, and access to credit, business networks, and tools); a “person-centered” approach (as opposed to “product-” or “policy-centered”); and a proper combination of business-related and training initiatives. A documented barrier is often the lack of coordination between public agencies, at different levels, with the private sector and local civil society representatives. Additionally, in the Brazilian context, it seems utterly important to balance efforts between measures that increase the labor welfare for all, while simultaneously striving to improve the business environment and incentivize microenterprises to register.},

	abstract = {Cities in the developing world are rapidly expanding, boosting countries’ economies, reducing poverty, and fueling global prosperity. But as more people, assets, and economic activity become concentrated in cities, and infrastructure struggles to keep up with rapid growth, the risk posed by natural disasters and climate change is rising. The urban poor – who are most exposed and least able to cope – will be hardest hit, with up to 77 million urban residents potentially falling back into poverty as a result of climate change alone. To help the urban poor unlock their full economic potential and protect hard-won development gains, the report discusses the need to invest in urban resilience. Over the next 15 years, at least 400 billion dollars will be needed each year to make city infrastructure low-emissions and more resilient to the wide range of shocks and stresses that cities may encounter. The flagship report -- co-authored by the World Bank Group and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery -- illustrates how building urban resilience is critical to reducing poverty and promoting shared prosperity. And while, over the last five years, the World Bank Group has financed more than \$9 billion in projects to help cities in 41 countries become more resilient, significant investment gaps remain. To overcome these gaps, the World Bank Group and other multilateral development institutions can play a critical role in enabling city and national governments leverage private},

	abstract = {The number of people in South Asia's cities rose by 130 million between 2000 and 2011--more than the entire population of Japan. This was linked to an improvement in productivity and a reduction in the incidence of extreme poverty. But the region's cities have struggled to cope with the pressure of population growth on land, housing, infrastructure, basic services, and the environment. As a result, urbanization in South Asia remains underleveraged in its ability to deliver widespread improvements in both prosperity and livability. 
 
 Leveraging Urbanization in South Asia is about the state of South Asia's urbanization and the market and policy failures that have taken the region’s urban areas to where they are today--and the hard policy actions needed if the region’s cities are to leverage urbanization better. This publication provides original empirical and diagnostic analysis of urbanization and related economic trends in the region. It also discusses in detail the key policy areas, the most fundamental being urban governance and finance, where actions must be taken to make cities more prosperous and livable.},

	abstract = {This study was made possible by the financial contribution of the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) and the Water Partnership Program (WPP). ESMAP is a global knowledge and technical assistance program for low- and middle-income countries to increase their know-how and institutional capacity to achieve environmentally sustainable energy solutions for poverty reduction and economic growth. WPP is a global partnership for improved water resources management and water service delivery. The World Bank Group administers both programs.
The study was prepared by the Water Environment \& Reuse Foundation (WE\&RF) under Contract No. 7171721 with the World Bank Group. The research was largely enabled by WE\&RF’s partner institutions for this study: La Universidad de los Andes, Colombia, and Natural Systems Utilities, United States and Colombia. Without their dedication to the project through the discussion of ideas, connecting WE\&RF with utilities and experts, and reviewing draft materials, this work would not have been possible. Their local expertise on issues facing Latin American utilities added perspective and depth to the project.
The research team would like to thank the following individuals from the World Bank Group for their time and direction to this project: Carmen Yee-Batista, Jean-Martin Brault, and Lara Chinarro. Thank you to Elvira Broeks and Pamela Duran for their help with logistics and to Inge Pakulski, editor, for her dedication and support in finalizing this report.
The research team also thanks Allison Deines of WE\&RF for her assistance with translation, Lola Olabode of WE\&RF for her early work on the project, and Tsenguun Tumurkhuyag, WE\&RF intern, for her contributions. Thank you to Jaime Alba of DC Water for his review of our work and translations. Special thanks to Nelson Castaño and others at the Asociación Colombiana de Ingeniería Sanitaria y Ambiental (ACODAL) for their collaboration on the Regional Workshop that helped inform the research of this project. Thank you to Barry Liner and the Water Environment Federation for their support and review of this project.
Finally, thank you to all the utilities in Latin America and the Caribbean who generously shared their experiences and pointed the research team to various resources and data. Their knowledge helped shape and strengthen this research effort. Special thanks to the water and wastewater utilities who spent additional time serving as case studies for this project. Their participation provided valuable insight for this report and all utilities seeking to achieve energy efficiency and recovery.},

Collecting data on firm-level innovation is challenging because of the subjective definition of what determines an innovation, a problem that is exacerbated in devel- oping countries where innovation is likely to be more incremental and less radical. This paper contributes to the literature by presenting the results of an experiment
aiming to identify the survey instrument that better cap- tures firm-level innovation in developing countries. The paper shows that a small set of questions included in a multi-topic, firm-level survey does not provide an accurate picture of firm-level innovation and tends to overestimate innovation rates. Issues related to framing explain some of the unreliability of innovation responses, while cog- nitive problems do not appear to play a significant role.},

The enzyme specifically hydrolyzed phosphatidylinositol, but did not act on phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and sphingomyelin, under the conditions examined. The products from phosphatidylinositol of enzyme reaction were diacylglycerols and a mixture of myoinositol 1- and 1, 2-cyclic phosphates, suggesting that the enzyme was a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. The enzyme released alkaline phosphatase quantitatively from rat kidney slices. A kinetic analysis was made on the release of alkaline phosphatase.

The recent advent of high resolution smart water meters and advanced data analytics allow for a new era of using the continuous ‘big data’ generated by these meter ﬂeets to create an intelligent system for urban water management to overcome this problem. The aim of this research is to provide infrastructure planners with a detailed understanding of how granular data generated by an intelligent water management system (Autoﬂow©) can be utilised to obtain signiﬁcant efﬁciencies throughout different stages of an urban water cycle, from supply, distribution, customer engagement, and even wastewater treatment.},

With sensors and analytic tools deployed island-wide to provide a real-time monitoring and decision support system, the Smart Water Grid system enables PUB to manage the water supply network efficiently, ensuring that all Singaporeans will continue to enjoy a reliable and sustainable water supply for generations to come.

For each aspect, the paper focuses on the challenges, current technology, PUB's experience with technology and identified gaps, and the technology roadmap.},

	abstract = {Many studies have reported the effect of water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in improving health and ultimately alleviating poverty. Current coverage estimates show however that a large proportion of people in the world still do not have access to a simple pit latrine or a source of safe drinking water, and this situation worsens in rural areas. To help end these appalling figures, much effort has gone into the development of policy instruments which support decision-making, i.e. planning, targeting and prioritization. Indices and indicators are increasingly recognised as powerful tools for such purposes. This paper details the theoretical framework and development of a multidimensional, WASH-focused, thematic indicator: the WASH Poverty Index (WASH PI). It describes the methodology in index construction and disseminates achieved results in a variety of forms to promote the utility of the tool for the integrated analysis of WASH and poverty linkages. The article uses Kenya as initial case study to illustrate the application of the index. Overall, WASH PI helps identify priority areas and guide appropriate action and policy-making towards improved service delivery.},

Differentials in the value of in-house and yard connections across governance approaches (municipal, private and community-managed services) are also investigated. The empirical analysis involves estimating hedonic models of stated rental prices for a large sample of urban and rural households in Guatemala. Findings indicate that urban households value municipal and private services. Conversely, urban households do not value piped water when provided by a community-managed system. Rural households seem to be more concerned about the distance of their primary source than about the type of water source.},

@article{essama-nssah_assessing_2018,
	title = {Assessing the performance of targeting mechanisms},
	abstract = {A policy intervention entails a distribution of social resources to a target population in order to solve a particular problem they face. In that context, targeting is designed to assign treatment according to some eligibility criterion. While eﬀective targeting is not an end in itself, it is central to both fairness and cost-eﬀectiveness in policymaking. Decision makers and other stakeholders would therefore like to know the extent to which targeting respects eligibility. Answering this key question is essentially an exercise in associational inference. This paper proposes an evaluative framework for assessing targeting outcomes. The framework focuses on measuring, judging and explaining targeting performance. Among indicators of performance considered, the conditional probability of assignment emerges as a local measure which is more informative than global indicators. The paper advocates for the use of chance-corrected measures of interobserver agreement to judge the extent of agreement between assignment mechanisms, and demonstrates the use of bivariate probit regression analysis to identify proximate determinants of targeting outcomes. The proposed framework is applied to the evaluation of the targeting of cash transfers in the context of the Social Safety Nets Pilot Project (SSNPP) in Northern Cameroon.},

It aims to provide understanding of water use from both a production and consumption point of view. The study identifies priority basins and areas from the perspectives of blue water scarcity, water pollution and deforestation. Wheat, fodder crops and sugarcane are identified as priority products related to blue water scarcity. The domestic sector is the priority sector regarding water pollution from nitrogen. Soybean and pasture are priority products related to deforestation. We estimate that consumptive water use in crop production could be reduced by 37\% and nitrogen-related water pollution by 44\% if water footprints were reduced to certain specified benchmark levels. The average WF per consumer in the region is 28\% larger than the global average and varies greatly, from 912 m3/year per capita in Nicaragua to 3468 m3/year in Bolivia. Ironically, the LAC region shows significant levels of undernourishment, although there is abundant water and food production in the region and substantial use of land and water for producing export crops like soybean.},

	abstract = {Given the broad array of issues and the complexity faced by the water sector as a whole (from irrigation to flood protection, to water conservation and hydropower), there is great demand for future exploring the potential of RBF and tackling the questions still unanswered about many of its operational dimensions. This document takes a closer look at some of the practical aspects of implementing various RBF water schemes. Chapter 2 provides an analytical framework to explore if and when RBF can be a viable option, shedding light on some key factors and preconditions that are necessary for RBF to work–with the understanding that it can be used either as an alternative or a complement to a more traditional input-based funding scheme. Chapter 3 then revisits the concepts discussed in the analytical framework through the analysis of various case studies of RBF approaches in different water-related areas. Some of the case studies are based on actual projects already implemented or ongoing, while others are an illustrative elaboration, given the lack of practical cases to use as sources. Chapter 4 presents some conclusions and lessons learned. The key challenges that are likely to be encountered in designing an RBF scheme deal with: the clarity and level of certainty of the relationships from input to output to outcomes (causal links); the ease and availability of measurable indicators; and, consequently, the optimal determination of the necessary incentive(s) to align the goals of the principal with the agents' deliverables. Appendix A presents a glossary of RBF concepts and acronyms. Appendix B presents specific results and indicators which may be relevant for different sectors.},

	abstract = {In Brazilian urban favelas, the development of informal connections is common, relatively easy to obtain, and allow citizens to acquire electricity eluding or reducing the regular charging of consumption. Genuine affordability problems and limited means of subsistence are the most important but not exhaustive explanation of theft and nonpayment problems afflicting energy distribution companies. With a preliminary evaluation of the project “Conviver: energia para viver melhor”, implemented in Belo Horizonte, this thesis studies the determinants of illegal connections and energy fraud in the context of low-income urban favelas. Using the tecnique of logistic regression, the study illustrates how the probability of engaging in illegal behavior is explained by the following concurring factors: inadequate energy provision and lacking equipment; income and affordability; inefficient and incorrect use of domestic electric appliances. Additionally, based on the Conviver sample of 15,279 households, the thesis provides an evaluation of the effectiveness of different pro-poor schemes (government poverty subsidies and electricity block tariffs) at subsidizing energy costs for poor customers. The analysis proves that social tariffs, even though not exclusively responsible, can be considered as factors that mitigate the occurrence of illegality. The type of social tariffs that work better are the ones that are more strictly connected to consumption, as opposed to those linked to poverty subsidies. This make a strong case for a “tariff engineering” that takes into serious account the electricity needs in term of consumption, and try to segment the customers to realistically match the actual needs (minimum; low-medium; houses with micro-businesses in the dwelling). As the preliminary outcomes of the Conviver program document, the positive effect of propoor tariff schemes will be even multiplied if combined with effort for the orientation of low-income customers to energy-saving behaviors.},

	abstract = {This report originated as a contribution to the “Program of Integrated Public Policies for the Youth,” through which the IDB is supporting the Brazilian Municipality of Fortaleza in fostering socio-economic inclusion for young people in disadvantaged contexts. The first contribution of the study is to offer a synthetic outline of the issues and challenges relative to social and productive exclusion of young people, distinguishing between developed and developing regions, with special attention to Brazil. The report identifies and outlines, with empirical evidence, the following five macro-challenges that youth employment currently poses to countries like Brazil. Namely: (a) insufficient educational attainment and quality; (b) poverty, vulnerability, and youth at risk; (c) mismatch in labor supply and demand; (d) lack of opportunities and high incidence of informality; and (e) expected labor market effects of the ongoing crisis. Against such a framework, the study identifies and describes eight worldwide best practices in the field of youth employment policies. The choice of the case studies maintains an explicit focus on programs with an emphasis on the promotion of self-employment and entrepreneurship as alternative tools to tap an existing under-exploited young entrepreneurial potential, in a context of shrinking labor demand from the public and formal sector. The identified most successful and sustainable programs (retrieved in a variety of different contexts) consistently show some common key success factors. In particular, they exhibit an emphasis on selection and targeting (according to age, education level, and access to credit, business networks, and tools); a “person-centered” approach (as opposed to “product-” or “policy-centered”); and a proper combination of business-related and training initiatives. A documented barrier is often the lack of coordination between public agencies, at different levels, with the private sector and local civil society representatives. Additionally, in the Brazilian context, it seems utterly important to balance efforts between measures that increase the labor welfare for all, while simultaneously striving to improve the business environment and incentivize microenterprises to register.},

	abstract = {The gap between the sophisticated Non-Revenue Water reduction programmes in well managed water utilities and the situation in many of the world’s water utilities (and especially in utilities in developing countries) is widening at a fast pace. In the last decade a comprehensive set of analytical tools, water loss reduction strategies and specialised equipment has been developed. The work of the IWA Operation and Maintenance Specialist Group in general and its Water Loss Task Force in particular has led to a set of performance indicators ideally suited to assess the water loss situation and to quantify the components of NRW. This paper is the first part of the outline of a basic NRW reduction strategy and is intended to motivate utility managers to establish a standard water balance, calculate the level of NRW, quantify its components and identify main problem areas. A separate paper, part 2 of this strategy, will deal with the planning of the strategy and its implementation.},

The proposed water rate is based on the following idea:RFB + RSB =CRUR + ERs +ERWS
 
RFB and RSB represent total perceived revenue from the first and second block, respectively, CRUR is the current revenue received under the uniform rate tariff structure, ERs represents the required extra revenue to cover subsidy costs, and ERWS is the additional revenue due to the increased tariff to signal water scarcity.

Y (Efficiency variables)

number of water economies3 (WE)
and number of sewage economies (SE),

GENERAL EFFECTS: The social dimension was rather affected by tariff growth when switching to AEEGSI regulation. Environmentalperformance improved with the ERC tariff component, but investments in the network and plants did not grow as expected. Financial perfor- mance was boosted by the higher amount of operating costs covered with allowed revenues. Meanwhile, productivity decreased, since MTI did not provide a strong incentive for cost reduction.

This paper argues the case for consumer involvement as an essential part of the regulatory process, not only to enable positive service development, but also as a means to support the legitimacy of young or fragile regulatory agencies. Risks and constraints of different arrangements for involvement are discussed based on an examination of international experiences. Case study ﬁndings suggest that there is scope for a more proactive approach under a more inclusive framework for consumer involvement, though the actual choice of mechanism to gauge consumers’ interests, for which there are numerous options, appears to be of lesser importance.},

DATA covers 25 Sub-Saharan countries from 1996 to 2012 SUb-Saharan Africa
Y : water coverage and its evolution over time. (IBNET)
X1 , the financial performance of water utilities is calculated as a ratio between collected revenues and O\&M costs, which is also the most commonly adopted indicator for cost recovery13 in the water sector (taken from the IBNET database).
(Another indicator taken from the IBNET database is Non Revenue Water (NRW), which is the proportion of produced water that is not billed. NRW accounts for technical losses, water granted for free, and for illegal connections (or meters tampering), while it does not include uncollected revenues.14) However, the indicator has some limitations: reflecting the importance of technical water losses, NRW is a better indicator for the conditions of the pipes then for the conditions of other key assets, such as treat- ment plants, water taps, and reservoirs. Moreover, this indica- tor is affected by illegal connections, inefficient billing, and legal unpaid use, which contribute to generate non revenue water regardless the importance of maintenance problems.
X2: Public expenditure for the water supply sectorThe variable used to represent fiscal expenditure in the regression is taken from the fiscal database of the Africa Infrastructure Knowledge Program of the AfDB. In particular, we consider the total “on budget public spending for water”. 
 
RESULTS  suggest that access to water depends upon financial results, but this relationship is not linear: 
-{\textgreater} the cost recovery positively contributes to the improvement of the water coverage up to a certain value, (by reassuring governments and donors about the sustainability of the utility itself and by providing funds from financial margins to complement public and donors’ funding. Beyond that value, this contribution first decreases and then changes to a negative effect.)
-{\textgreater} good financial results do not necessarily translate into corresponding increases in coverage, (utilities urged to achieve financial results might be prevented from providing water services to low-income customers.)
-{\textgreater} climitations and risks associated with overreliance on tariffs and to the debate about the appropriate level of cost recovery in the water sector },

We argue that their rationales were contradictory; decentralization was intended to increase citizen participation and inﬂuence, whereas corporatization and privatization were intended to depoliticize management. We document the widespread promotion and adoption of these reforms, and conclude that decentralization made it diﬃcult to insulate service provision in practice. We argue that studying how institutional reforms interact with one another can help explain reform consequences.},

FINDINGS: 
Our review of cases in which decentralization and insulating reforms were adopted in tandem suggests that bringing service provision “closer to the people” and inviting greater citizen participation has made it difficult to shield utilities management from politics, and particularly from political opposition to cost recovery measures. Administrative decentralization increases the salience of W\&S policy; it becomes one of a few major local policy areas in which politicians can cater to citizens.3 Particularly in democratic and quasidemocratic settings, this discourages politicians from implementing controversial policies, even if they would contribute to the fiscal sustainability and quality and reach of utility services in the long run.

	abstract = {Benchmarking is essential for those developing and implementing water policy. If decision-makers do not know where they have been or where they are, it would seem to be impossible to set reasonable targets for future performance. Information on water/sewerage system (WSS) operations, investments, and outputs is essential for good management and oversight. This book is designed to help decision makers identify the data required for performance comparisons over time and across water utilities, to understand the strengths and limitations of alternative benchmarking methodologies, and to perform (or commission) benchmark studies. This book provides an overview of the strengths and limitations of different methodologies for making performance comparisons over time and across water utilities (metric benchmarking). In addition, it identifies ways to determine the robustness of performance rankings. Current benchmarking activities in Latin America, Asia, Africa, Central Europe/Asia, and OECD nations are summarized. Five basic approaches to benchmarking characterize current studies: Core indicators and a summary or overall performance Indicator (partial metric method), Performance scores based on production or cost estimates ("total" methods), Performance relative to a model company (engineering approach), Process benchmarking, and Customer survey benchmarking. This volume is of interest to the water professionals, water utility managers and senior staff of regulatory agencies, professionals in related government agencies, and consultants. The Associa o Brasileira de Ag ncias de Regula o ABAR, recognizes and applauds the merits of this book. We welcome the way Sanford Berg's underscores the critical need for key information about how service is affected by the efficiency of water and sewerage operations, investments, and incentives. Without benchmarking methodologies, policy-makers, regulators and managers do not know where they have been nor where they are, and it is impossible for them to establish feasible performance targets to be reached by operators.

Water is understood as a natural and social common good, and the relations between different uses and current management practices are analyzed.

Therefore, a policy effective integration of the comprehensive and interdisciplinary understanding of water problems is advocated and proposed under the concept of integrated urban water policy (IUWP). The final objective is a contribution to an adequate conceptual and operational framework that enables a better and more effective understanding of the multiple dimensions and complexity of integrated management of water uses, in coherent relation with land use planning.},

	abstract = {Despite huge differences in population, household income and development levels, Australia and Brazil have some temporal convergences in their water governance systems. Over the last 20 years, both countries have signiﬁcantly reformed their water policies and practices by introducing a legal foundation for more integrated and participatory catchment/basin management based on the best information available. A critical test of any water reform is how effective it is in meeting the challenges of extreme and unpredictable conditions of drought and ﬂoods, which are expected to increase under climate changes scenarios. This paper compared the contemporary water governance frameworks of Australia and Brazil in relation to three elements of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM): integration, participation, and information/knowledge. We focused on insights from Brazil’s recent drought and Australia’s ﬂuctuating water crises to derive lessons and recommendations for future changes. Among the main recommendations, we stress the need for both systems to improve effective participation and to embrace a more comprehensive approach to cope with water scarcity in future scenarios. Furthermore, water related decisions should be based on a transparent and well informed process, and take into account the lessons from similar situations worldwide in order to avoid unnecessary or ineffective measures. As demonstrated in the Australian case during the Millennium Drought, the most effective initiatives were those involving government, the private sector and society to achieve a more sustainable consumption pattern in all sectors. There is much to learn from the Brazilian and Australia experiences in water reforms and crises, but it is imperative to understand the social, economic and environmental context within which these took place. Continuing to develop the capacity and willingness of researchers and policy makers to work together can make an important contribution towards meeting the growing and spreading challenges in water resource management around the world.},

	abstract = {To many, reducing water losses is seen as key to more
sustainable water management. The arguments to reduce
water losses are compelling, but reducing water losses has
turned out to be challenging. This paper applies a panel
data analysis with fixed effects to determine the major drivers
of non-revenue water, which is define as the volume of
water losses per kilometer of network per day. The analysis
uses data from the International Benchmarking Network
for Water and Sanitation Utilities, covering utilities in 68
countries between 2006 and 2011. The analysis finds that
non-revenue water is driven by many factors. Some of the
most important drivers are beyond the control of the utility,
such as population density per kilometer of network, the
type of distribution network, and the length of the network,
which are largely the result of urbanization and settlement
patterns in the localities that the utility serves. The opportunity
costs of water losses are also key in explaining what
drives non-revenue water. The paper finds that very low
opportunity costs of water losses have an adverse effect on
the reduction of non-revenue water. Country fixed effects
turn out to be important, meaning that the environment
in which the utility operates has an important impact on
non-revenue water levels. An important conclusion is that
the design of non-revenue water reduction programs should
study the main drivers of non-revenue water to provide
utility managers with a better understanding of what can
be achieved in terms of non-revenue water reduction and
whether the benefits of these reductions exceed their costs.},

The ability to present these data in a gridded format as opposed to the traditionally reported administrative units is advantageous for incorporation with other environmental datasets. Night-time light remote sensing data has been shown to correlate with national-level figures of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Night-time radiance data is analysed here along with regional economic productivity data for 11 European Union countries along with the United States at a number of sub-national levels. Night-time light imagery was found to correlate with Gross Regional Product (GRP) across a range of spatial scales. Maps of economic activity at 5 km resolution were produced based on the derived relationships.

Reliable statistics, including estimates of economic growth rates and per-capita income, are basic to the operation of governments in developing countries and vital to nongovernmental organizations and other entities that provide financial aid to them. Rich countries and international financial institutions such as the World Bank allocate their development resources on the basis of such data. The paucity of accurate statistics is not merely a technical problem; it has a massive impact on the welfare of citizens in developing countries.Where do these statistics originate? How accurate are they? Poor Numbers is the first analysis of the production and use of African economic development statistics. Morten Jerven's research shows how the statistical capacities of sub-Saharan African economies have fallen into disarray. The numbers substantially misstate the actual state of affairs. As a result, scarce resources are misapplied. Development policy does not deliver the benefits expected. Policymakers' attempts to improve the lot of the citizenry are frustrated. Donors have no accurate sense of the impact of the aid they supply. Jerven's findings from sub-Saharan Africa have far-reaching implications for aid and development policy. As Jerven notes, the current catchphrase in the development community is "evidence-based policy," and scholars are applying increasingly sophisticated econometric methods―but no statistical techniques can substitute for partial and unreliable data.},

Many methods are used to disaggregate census data and predict population densities for finer scale, gridded population data sets. We present a new semi-automated dasymetric modeling approach that incorporates detailed census and ancillary data in a flexible, “Random Forest” estimation technique. We outline the combination of widely available, remotely-sensed and geospatial data that contribute to the modeled dasymetric weights and then use the Random Forest model to generate a gridded prediction of population density at {\textasciitilde}100 m spatial resolution. This prediction layer is then used as the weighting surface to perform dasymetric redistribution of the census counts at a country level. As a case study we compare the new algorithm and its products for three countries (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Kenya) with other common gridded population data production methodologies. We discuss the advantages of the new method and increases over the accuracy and flexibility of those previous approaches. Finally, we outline how this algorithm will be extended to provide freely-available gridded population data sets for Africa, Asia and Latin America.},

Our method, which requires only publicly available data, could transform efforts to track and target poverty in developing countries. It also demonstrates how powerful machine learning techniques can be applied in a setting with limited training data, suggesting broad potential application across many scientific domains.},

	abstract = {During the past few decades, technologies such as remote sensing, geographical information systems, and global positioning systems have transformed the way the distribution of human population is studied and modeled in space and time. However, the mapping of populations remains constrained by the logistics of censuses and surveys. Consequently, spatially detailed changes across scales of days, weeks, or months, or even year to year, are difficult to assess and limit the application of human population maps in situations in which timely information is required, such as disasters, conflicts, or epidemics. Mobile phones (MPs) now have an extremely high penetration rate across the globe, and analyzing the spatiotemporal distribution of MP calls geolocated to the tower level may overcome many limitations of census-based approaches, provided that the use of MP data is properly assessed and calibrated. Using datasets of more than 1 billion MP call records from Portugal and France, we show how spatially and temporarily explicit estimations of population densities can be produced at national scales, and how these estimates compare with outputs produced using alternative human population mapping methods. We also demonstrate how maps of human population changes can be produced over multiple timescales while preserving the anonymity of MP users. With similar data being collected every day by MP network providers across the world, the prospect of being able to map contemporary and changing human population distributions over relatively short intervals exists, paving the way for new applications and a near real-time understanding of patterns and processes in human geography.},

Yet, the relationship between the physical and social components of urban change is not well understood due to the lack of comprehensive measures of neighborhood appearance. Here, we introduce a computer vision method to quantify change in physical appearance of streetscapes and generate a dataset of physical change for five large American cities. We combine this dataset with socioeconomic indicators to explore whether demographic and economic changes precede, follow, or co-occur with changes in physical appearance. We find that the strongest predictors of improvement in a neighborhood’s physical appearance are population density and share of college-educated adults. Other socioeconomic characteristics, like median income, share of vacant homes, and monthly rent, do not predict improvement in physical appearance. We also find that neighborhood appearances converge to the initial appearances of bordering areas, supporting the Burgess “invasion” theory. In addition, physical appearance is more likely to improve in neighborhoods proximal to the central business district. Finally, we find modest support for “tipping” and “filtering” theories of urban change.},

Intra-annual price changes or customer differentiation to reflect differences in marginal costs can enhance efficiency. A marginal cost pricing mechanism may signal the value that consumers attribute to further capacity expansions as the water supply system approaches its capacity limit and marginal cost rises. However, pure marginal cost pricing may not be feasible while respecting a revenue requirement because marginal costs may be higher or lower than average costs. The most common ways of combining efficiency and revenue requirements are through the use of two-part tariffs, adjusting the fixed charge to meet the revenue requirement, or through second-best pricing like Ramsey pricing. It is not evident whether the best scheme is a two-part tariff or some other pricing mechanism. The role of block rate pricing, increasingly more frequent in actual pricing practices, is yet to be fully investigated.},

In December 2014, Esri published the initial version of the World Population Estimate (WPE) image service to ArcGIS Online. The service represents a dasymetric footprint of human settlement at 250-meter resolution. It is global and contains an estimate of the 2013 population for each populated cell. In 2016 Esri published an additional image service representing the earth’s population in 2015 at 162-meter resolution. Esri’s WPE is produced by combining classified land cover data indicating predominantly built-up or agricultural locations with Landsat8 Panchromatic imagery, road intersections, and known populated places. The model detects where settlement is likely to exist beyond the areas classified as predominantly built up. The result is a global dasymetric raster surface of the footprint of settlement with a score of the likelihood of human settlement for each cell of the footprint. Population data are apportioned to this settlement likelihood surface by overlaying population counts in polygons representing census enumeration units or political units representing population surveys. This paper presents the method developed at Esri for producing the estimate of settlement likelihood.},

We conducted the ﬁrst global survey of the large cities’ water sources, and show that previous global hydrologic models that ignored urban water infrastructure signiﬁcantly overestimated urban water stress. Large cities obtain 78 Æ 3\% of their water from surface sources, some of which are far away: cumulatively, large cities moved 504 billion liters a day (184 km3 yrÀ1) a distance of 27,000 Æ 3800 km, and the upstream contributing area of urban water sources is 41\% of the global land surface. Despite this infrastructure, one in four cities, containing \$4.8 Æ 0.7 trillion in economic activity, remain water stressed due to geographical and ﬁnancial limitations. The strategic management of these cities’ water sources is therefore important for the future of the global economy.},

	abstract = {The relationship between urbanization, economic growth, and water use change is one of the key issues for China’s sustainable development, as rapid urbanization and continuous economic growth are accompanied by a steady water stress. Thus, we applied a cointegration test and a VECM (vector error correction model) Granger causality test to investigate the causal relationship between the urbanization level, the economic development level, and the total water use in China and its 31 provincial administrative regions during 1997–2013. Results show that the three indicators have a long-run equilibrium relationship in most provincial administrative regions in China. However, the short-run effects and Granger causal relationship are insigniﬁcant for China and most provincial administrative regions. Therefore, that an idea such as urbanization as the engine or major driving force of economic growth, and that China’s urbanization and economic growth will bring a water crisis and will be strongly constrained by water resources, might be properly weakened. Targeted and relatively separate policies should be emphasized more for the coordinated development of China’s urbanization, economy, and water resources.},

Lo anterior muestra que, aunque se han logrado avances importantes en llevar infraestructura de agua potable y de alcantarillado a la población, ahora es necesario mejorar la gestión para lograr que la población reciba los servicios de forma adecuada y ejerza su derecho al agua potable y al saneamiento.
